============================

Once we actually get started working on things, I'm sure I'll come up with more to add to this. Until then here are some notes.



## Useful things

[Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html)

[Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/index.html)

[Python Standard Library Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html)

[Python Coding Standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)

Once I look more closely at the assignment, I'll add more to the README to make things clearer.

### Notes on committing

1 There will be two (possibly more) branches. One will be master, one will be devel. Commit to __devel__.

2 If you want to create your own branch and push everything to that, go for it.

3 Remember to pull the most recent changes before you start working. It would be a waste of time if I already made the changes you spent hours working on.

4 Remember to push your work when you finish.
